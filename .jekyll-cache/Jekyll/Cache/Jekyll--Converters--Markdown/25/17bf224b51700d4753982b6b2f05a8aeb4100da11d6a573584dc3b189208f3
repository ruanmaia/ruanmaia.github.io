I"<p>Hey! This is Ruan Carlos Maia.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a Senior SRE/DevOps Engineer from Brazil <span>ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·</span>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been working as a software engineer for about 12 years. I started my career as a Python Developer and after some time building code for automate things, I decided to change my path a little bit and dive into the infraestructure universe.</p>

<p>Without realizing it, I ended up becoming a mixed professional, combining the roles of a software engineer (dev) and a system administrator (ops). By the way, Iâ€™d be called a DevOps Engineer ğŸ˜.</p>

<p>Soâ€¦</p>

<p>Today, my focus is on building and design reliable, scalable and fault-tolerant systems.</p>

<p>Python, AWS, K8s and Terraform are my favorite technologies. Beside that, there are some other tools I like to play.</p>

<p>The main goal of this blog is to maintain a kind of â€œpublic software engineering knowlege baseâ€â€¦ and, of course, to aggreate my personal notes about interesting architectures, libraries and anything that I want.</p>
