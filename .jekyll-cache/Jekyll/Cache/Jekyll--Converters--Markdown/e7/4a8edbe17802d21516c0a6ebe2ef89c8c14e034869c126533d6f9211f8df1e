I"	<p>Hey! This is Ruan Carlos Maia.</p>

<p>I’m a Senior SRE/DevOps Engineer from Brazil <span>🇧🇷</span>.</p>

<p>I’ve been working as a software engineer for about 12 years. I started my career as a Python Developer and after some time building code for automate things, I decided to change my path a little bit and dive into the infraestructure universe.</p>

<p>Without realizing it, I ended up becoming a mixed professional, combining the roles of a Software Engineer (Dev) and a System Administrator (Ops). By the way, I would be called a DevOps Engineer 😎.</p>

<p>So…</p>

<p>Today, my focus is on building, design and maintain reliable, scalable and fault-tolerant systems.</p>

<p><strong>Python</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>K8s</strong> and <strong>Terraform</strong> are my favorites. Beside that, there are some other tools I like to play:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elastic Stack (ELK)</li>
  <li>Prometheus/Grafana</li>
  <li>Locust</li>
</ul>

<p>The main goal of this blog is to maintain a kind of “personal-software-engineering-knowlege-base”… and, of course, to aggreate my notes about interesting architectures, libraries and anything else.</p>
