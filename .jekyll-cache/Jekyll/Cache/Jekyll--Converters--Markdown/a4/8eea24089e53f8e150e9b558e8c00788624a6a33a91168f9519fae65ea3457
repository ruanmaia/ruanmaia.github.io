I"z<p>Hey! This is Ruan Carlos Maia.</p>

<p>I’m a Senior SRE/DevOps Engineer from Brazil <span>🇧🇷</span>.</p>

<p>I’ve been working as a software engineer for about 12 years. I started my career as a Python Developer and after some time building code for automate things, I decided to change my path a little bit and dive into the infraestructure universe.</p>

<p>Without realizing it, I ended up becoming a mixed professional, combining the roles of a software engineer (dev) and a system administrator (ops). By the way, I’d be called a DevOps Engineer 😎.</p>

<p>So…</p>

<p>Today, my focus is on building and design reliable, scalable and fault-tolerant systems.</p>

<p>Python, AWS, K8s and Terraform are among my favorite technologies.</p>
