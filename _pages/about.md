Hey! This is Ruan Carlos Maia. 

I'm a SRE/DevOps Engineer from Brazil <span>&#x1f1e7;&#x1f1f7;</span>. 

I've been working as a software engineer for about 12 years. I started my career as a Python Developer and after some time building code for automate things, I decided to change my path a little bit and dive into the infraestructure universe. 

Without realizing it, I ended up becoming a mixed professional, combining the roles of a Software Engineer (Dev) and a System Administrator (Ops). By the way, I would be called a DevOps Engineer 😎.

So...

Today, my focus is on building, design and maintain reliable, scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

**Python**, **AWS**, **K8s** and **Terraform** are my favorites. Beside that, there are some other tools that I like to play:

- Grafana / Prometheus
- FluentD / Fluendbit
- Elastic Search / Kibana
- Redis / RethinkDB / MongoDB
- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- Consul / Vault / Nomad
- Kafka / RabbitMQ / Celery

The main goal of this blog is to maintain a kind of **"personal-software-engineering-knowlege-base"**... and, of course, to aggregate my thoughts about anything else.
